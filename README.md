# ChaosCode
Attempt at creating organized collection of little handy snippets of code I'm receiving along the way

I always considered coding and programming as my weak side,  
**I want to document stuff to such depth that even non-programmers should be able to manage the job**  
- including step by step instructions together with installing dependencies!  


# dotfiles

I'm maining __Termux__, using __Emacs__ *(mostly as organiser with casual programming)*  
And those files here are result of me trying to create some optimal,  
ergonomic, comfortable setup to use.

Forever work in progress!

The grind has been long, and I've lost countless nights trying to set up some parts of it.  
I'm not sure how intuitive those files will be to others  
especially since I tried to personalize it for myself.  
At the very least I tried to comment quite a bit of what's inside,  
so any code traveler can inspect and lift pieces of code they fancy!
