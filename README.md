# ChaosCode
Attempt at creating organized collection of little handy snippets of code I'm receiving along the way

I always considered coding and programming as my weak side,  
**I want to document stuff to such depth that even non-programmers should be able to manage the job**  
including step by step instructions together with installing dependencies, dealing with bugs - whatever I got energy for!

# dotfiles

I'm maining __Termux__, using __Emacs__ *(mostly as organiser with casual programming)*  
While on my Windows 11 pc I'm using Ubuntu WSL2
And those files here are result of me trying to create some optimal,  
ergonomic, comfortable setup to use.

###  *Forever work in progress!*
The grind has been long, and I've lost countless nights trying to set up some parts of it.  
Nowadays I'm proud of quite few bits I made here, and I'm hoping they can be useful to anyone  
At the very least I tried to comment with detail what's going on in most of the scripts,  
so any code traveler can inspect and lift pieces of code they fancy!
