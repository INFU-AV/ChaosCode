# ChaosCode
Attempt at creating organized collection of little handy snippets of code I'm receiving along the way

I always considered coding and programming as my weak side, **I want to document stuff to such depth that even non-programmers should be able to manage the job** - including step by step instructions together with installing dependencies!

# My setup

### Windows

-CMD <br>
-WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) currently Debian

### Android

-Termux

#### running on both:

-Python (newest / current one, 3.something?) <br>
-p7zip (managing packages) (https://www.7-zip.org/) <br>
-SoX (audio processing) (http://sox.sourceforge.net/Main/HomePage) <br>
